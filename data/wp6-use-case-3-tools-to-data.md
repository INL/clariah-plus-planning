## Description

For some time now, researchers and content experts of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB) have been wanting to realise digital access for text- and data-mining-based research on digital and digitised sources in the collections of the KB, without the need to copy the collection to the user. In short, the idea is that a researcher can query the textual content of selections from the collections in the Digital Repository (DM) of the KB by API, by graphical interface or by "kerend algorithm", and receive as a result vocabulary, word frequencies, "word embeddings" or the result of the algorithm. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the use case is to investigate the possibilities of such an environment using KB collections, with as one of the results a proof of concept that can be fitted into CLAAS. 

This use case aims to deliver the following: 

* Descriptions of the foreseen users and their issues
* Requirements developed from a researcher/user perspective by means of extensive user testing
* Insight into the possibilities of making (copyright protected) collections available from the KB:
 * in relation to general policy choices
 * in relation to the Digital Repository
* Insight into the legal (im)possibilities
* Infrastructural requirements/possibilities according to CLAAS (theory)
* Proof of concept environment in cooperation with WP2-CLAAS with various possibilities such as;
 * Selection mechanism to compile collections based on metadata and/or full text 
 * Reliable EPUB parser for (on demand) conversion of EPUB to plain text
 * Services to parse and metadata plain text for:
   * Tokens, types
   * Type frequencies
   * n-grams
   * Embeddings
   * Lemma
   * Context
   * Syntactic function
 * API for above
 * Jupyter Notebook-like interface/access
 * Graphical shell for above
* Recommendations for the development of a production version that fits within CLARIAH+ and the KB infrastructure

At the end of the use case we will have as much knowledge as possible about this new way of making (copyright protected) collections available, we will know what the user requirements are for the proposed service and we will have a proof of concept on which we can build further. 


### What is the research about?

(mention the research project, the research domain, e.g., linguistics or media studies, and research question if relevant)

### What problem is hindering the research?

(What is currently lacking that inhibits this research?)

### What is needed to do the research?

(How can we go about solving this problem?)

#### Data

(if known, describe the data that are needed for the intended research, be as specific as possible)

#### Tools

(if known, describe what tools or functionalities you need to work with the data and do the research. Take the different stadia of the research into account, such as exploration phase, distant reading, close reading, annotating data, publishing, etc. Be as specific as possible)

### What software and services are involved?

(if known, what existing software and services are involved, which need to be developed? Please link to the tools if possible and specify whether it can be used as is, needs extra work, needs to be developed from scratch etc.)

### How to evaluate this?

(How do we evaluate the solution to the problem?)
